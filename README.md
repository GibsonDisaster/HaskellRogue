# Haskell Rogue

Haskell Rogue is a RogueLike game written in Haskell using the Ansi-Terminal library. Code originally based off of the code 
written by Moss Collum, though I have changed and written most of it.

## Getting Started

To run, have GHC installed and type "./run" while in the HaskellRogue Directory. 

## Built With

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) - Compiler
* [Moss Collums Original Code] (https://github.com/moss/haskell-roguelike-challenge/tree/master/2-i-am-that-merry-wanderer-of-the-night) - My original inspiration for this project.
